# Bonan Luan's Challenge Portfolio

This repository contains my solutions to various small-scale programming challenges/problems/exercises that I find and/or come up with, mainly as a way to showcase my skills and programming style. Still under construction.

Challenges:

- [Subsequence Indices](typescript-challenges/code/subsequence-indices.ts) ([tests](typescript-challenges/code/subsequence-indices.test.ts)) [TypeScript, property-based testing, data structures & algorithms]
- [Fibonacci Order](typescript-challenges/code/fibonacci-order.ts) ([tests](typescript-challenges/code/fibonacci-order.test.ts)) [TypeScript, unit testing, property-based testing, data structures & algorithms, complexity analysis, object-oriented programming]
- [Extract Strings](typescript-challenges/code/extract-strings.ts) ([tests](typescript-challenges/code/extract-strings.test.ts)) [TypeScript, unit testing, property-based testing, data structures & algorithms, parsing, state machines]

- [Rainfall + tests](rust_challenges/src/rainfall.rs) [Rust, unit testing, data structures & algorithms, dynamic programming, complexity analysis, macros]

Helper code:

- [Grid + tests](rust_challenges/src/grid.rs) [Rust, unit testing, object-oriented programming]
